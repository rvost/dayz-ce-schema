DayZ Central Economy mission files modding made easy!

This extension aims to provide accurate validation that not only detects broken XML (the only type of error that online validators can detect), but also checks for DayZ-specific schema compliance and semantic errors such as referencing non-existent files, spelling errors in flag names and other referenced values, and so on.
It also provides context sensitive auto-completion to make typing those lengthy classnames faster and less error-prone.
As you would expect from a modern editor, the extension provides code actions to automate common tasks and encourage good habits (such as file splitting).
And other useful features such as tooltips and the "Open Documentation" command.

Happy editing!

### Snippets

The following snippets are currently available:

- `typ` - type snippet for `types.xml`, including all elements except `tag`;
- `evn` - event snippet for `events.xml`;
- `msg-d` - message snippet with a deadline;
- `msg-r` - repeating message snippet;
- `msg-c` - on connection message snippet;
- `spwn-a` - spawnable type with attachment snippet;
- `spwn-c` - spawnable type with cargo snippet;
- `spwn-p` - spawnable type with preset snippet;
- `ldt-s` - loadout slot snippet for spawning gear configuration;
- `ldt-i` - loadout item snippet for spawning gear configuration.

### Planed features

- Provide full project validation.
- Provide quick fixes for common validation errors.
- More code actions for day-to-day task automation.
- One-click navigation to symbols (e.g. to the preset referenced in `cfgspawnabletypes.xml`).
- Classnames auto-completion in JSON files

## Requirements

**This extension requires [Java](https://www.java.com/)** (17 or newer), so make sure you have this installed.

It also relies on the [XML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml) for schema validation, but this can be installed automatically if you don't have it.

## Known Issues

- Only open files can be validated. You won't get any validation errors until you open the file in the editor.

- Completion and validation for Object Spawner custom lists currently only works  for json files in the `objectSpawners` folder.
For example, the `objectSpawners/nwaf.json` file will have completion and validation according to the [Object Spawner](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki?title=DayZ%3AObject_Spawner) rules, but `custom/berezino.json` or `altartrader.json` will not.
*This is due to limitations of the VS Code JSON Schema API and may be resolved in the future.* 

- Completion and validation for Spawning Gear Configuration currently only works for json files in the `spawnPresets` folder **or** files which name ends with `_loadout` (e.g. `deathmatch_loadout.json`).

- Fragments inserted by code actions may not be formatted correctly. You can easily fix this with auto-formatting (`Shift+Alt+F` by default).
